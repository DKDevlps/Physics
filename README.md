## ðŸŸ¦ Problem 1: Friction-Limited Speed on a Flat Turn

A motorcycle of mass **250â€¯kg** is taking a flat turn of radius **50.0â€¯m**.  
The coefficient of static friction between the tires and the road is:

\[
\mu_s = 0.65
\]

### âœ… Solution:

The frictional force provides the **centripetal force**:

\[
f_s = \mu_s F_N = \mu_s mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Cancel out mass \( m \) from both sides:

\[
\mu_s g = \frac{v^2}{r} \Rightarrow v = \sqrt{\mu_s g r}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
v = \sqrt{0.65 \times 9.8 \times 50} = \sqrt{318.5} \approx 17.8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### âœ… **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{17.8 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

## ðŸŸ¦ Problem 2: Minimum Coefficient of Friction for Circular Motion

A child (mass = **35â€¯kg**) is running in a circle of radius **6.0â€¯m** on a flat playground.  
If they run at **4.2â€¯m/s**, what is the **minimum coefficient of static friction** needed to avoid slipping?

### âœ… Solution:

Friction again provides the centripetal force:

\[
\mu_s mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Cancel mass \( m \):

\[
\mu_s = \frac{v^2}{rg}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
\mu_s = \frac{(4.2)^2}{6 \times 9.8} = \frac{17.64}{58.8} \approx 0.30
\]

### âœ… **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\mu_s = 0.30}
\]

## ðŸŸ¦ Problem 3: Object on a Rotating Platform

A person of mass **70â€¯kg** stands **1.8â€¯m** from the center of a rotating flat platform.  
The platform completes one rotation every **4.5 seconds**.  
What is the **minimum coefficient of static friction** required to keep the person from sliding?

### âœ… Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate linear speed

\[
v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = \frac{2\pi \times 1.8}{4.5} \approx 2.51 \, \text{m/s}
\]

#### Step 2: Use the centripetal force equation with friction

\[
\mu_s = \frac{v^2}{rg}
\]

\[
\mu_s = \frac{(2.51)^2}{1.8 \times 9.8} = \frac{6.30}{17.64} \approx 0.357
\]

### âœ… **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\mu_s = 0.36}
\]

## ðŸŸ¦ Problem 4: Tension and Circular Motion on a Flat Surface

A **1.2â€¯kg** ball is tied to a string and whirled in a **horizontal circle** of radius **0.90â€¯m**.  
If it moves at a speed of **3.5â€¯m/s**, what is the **tension in the string**?

### âœ… Solution:

Tension provides the centripetal force:

\[
T = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Substitute values:

\[
T = \frac{1.2 \times (3.5)^2}{0.9} = \frac{1.2 \times 12.25}{0.9} = \frac{14.7}{0.9} \approx 16.3 \, \text{N}
\]

### âœ… **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{16.3 \, \text{N}}
\]
